Living a healthy life has been goal of a lot of people as it makes you feel better and you can live your life to more extend thus a lot of people are doing different things to make themselves healthy. Many says that prevention is better than cure and belive that instead of investing in cure and treating diseases we should invest in different methods of preventing that disease. This essay will discuss and explain why prevention is a better option and give evidence for the same.

Staying healthy for a long period of time is crucial for some people. To put it simply, in today's world a lot of development is needed and going on at a very fast pace which require us to work under deadlines. for instance, a sportsmen or an athelete require themseleves to stay fit every single day to give their best and for that they couldn't get sick and that's the reason they prefer to stay healthy by prevention of diseases and eating healthy food. Reserch shows that the people who do regular exercises and eat healthy are less likely to get any kind of disease. More healthier your are less diseases you will get.

It is true that, researhching and curing a disease is very leanthy as well as costly process. In more detailed view A single vaccine can take much longer and has a lot of different phases before it can be fully consumed by public. for example, recent covid virus has effected the whole world almost 2 years, scientics and other experts were not able to find the cure so fast that they could control the virus. Thus, investing more in regular checkups, gym and healthy fruits would be a great alternative to cure a disease.

To conclude, despite cure is an option, I strongly belive that prevention should be considered rather that cure. with a few effort on exercising and eating healthy food a person could live a happy life free from diseases.
