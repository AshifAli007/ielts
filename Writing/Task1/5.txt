The bar chart details fast food consumption in the United States in 2003, 2006, and 2013. Looking from an overall perspective it is readily apparent that frequent consumption of fast food, defined as at least once a week, generally became less common though having fast food once a week or once or twice a month remained the dominant trends. The only exception to this pattern is not eating fast food, which declined.

Looking first of all at the most pervasive habits, in 2003, 31% of individual ate fast food once a week compared to 30% eating it once or twice a month. From there, these trends diverged with those eating once a week rising to 34% in 2006 and then falling precipitously to 27% by 2013. Eating once or twice a month fell to 25% and then surged to 34% in the final year.

The figure for those eating fast food several times a week stood at 17% in 2003, rose to 20% in 2006 and dipped to a low of 15% in 2013. In contrast, in 2003, 13% of individuals consumed fast food a few times a year and this number stabilized at 15% for the final two years recorded. The numbers for every day and never were nearly identical with the former at 4% in 2003 and then 3% and the latter starting at 5% and reaching a low of 4% in both 2006 and 2013.
