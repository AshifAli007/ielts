The two pie charts depicts the differences in proportion of multiple Energy production in France in year 1995 and 2005.

Overall, it is readily apparent that coal was the only Enrgy source which has highest energy production in both years. Petro was the only Energy source that shows a decline in productions. Highest gain in production can be shown in other Energy sources whereas coal, Gas and Nuclear shows slight increase over the period of time.

In 1995, the production of Coal was less than one third of overall production which shows a slight increase in production to almost 30.93%, similar growth can be seen in case of Gas which increased from 29.63% to 30.31% between the years.

The production of petro shows a decrease in production through the years, falling from 29.27% to 19.55% in 2005 which is the third highly produced energy source.On the other hand, Other's and Nuclear energy sources shows a considerable increase of around 5% each, increasing from around 10% to aproximately 20% in 2005 collectively.
