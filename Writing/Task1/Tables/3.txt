The given table illustrates the 3 categories (Date opened, kilometres of route, passengers per year in millions) of an underground railway systems in six major cities.

Overall, it is readily apparent that paris and tokyo accounts for a largest number of passengers travelled by underground railway. This figure is also higher for London but Washington DC kyouto adn LA has drastically lower passangers. London railway systems are established much earlier than other cities railway system and los angeles was the latest established railway system.

In Tokyo, passangers travelling by underground railways is highest with  1928 million people travelling per year. The count for Paris is also high(1191 million). The kilometres of route are marginaly same for both tokyo and paris with about 199km and 155 km respectively. The two railway systems established at around 27years of gap between them the first was established in Paris in 1900 and another in 1927.

Railway systems in London established in 1863  compared to Los Angeles which establied much later(in 2001). The kilometes of route in London is around 400km which is more than double of routes in wathicngton DC with only 126km. The differece in passangers travellig by underground is also high with 775 million people in london compared to  only 144 million in washington DC which is more than 6 times.

Kyoto and los Angeles are the cities with lowest number of passsanger travellign under groun per year with about 45 and 50 million people respectively. the lenght of routes is only 39 km collectively. both the railways systems are established in early centuries.

=====================================

The table displays the date opened, number of kilometers and passengers each year in millions for subway systems in various cities. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the earlier underground railways tend to be longer and now serve more passengers per year relative to the more recent ones. Tokyo stands out for serving by far the most passengers and London for being both the oldest and largest.

London opened first (1863) and is nearly twice as expansive (394 kilometers) as the second largest subway, in Paris, which opened in 1900 and is 199 kilometers long. However, Paris now has more passengers compared to London (1,191,000,000 to 775,000,000). Tokyo was the next oldest having been constructed in 1927 with routes measuring a total of 155 kilometers and being made use of by 1,928,000,000 passengers annually.

The more modern subways are Washington D.C. (1976), Kyoto (1981), and Los Angeles (2001). Washington is the largest of the 3 at 126 kilometers with 144,000,000 yearly passengers. Kyoto is by far the smallest (11 kilometers) and serves relatively few individuals (45 million). Similarly, the Los Angeles subway is 18 kilometers in cumulative length and only 50,000,000 people travel on it each year.
