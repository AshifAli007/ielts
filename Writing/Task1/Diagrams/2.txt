The process details the steps by which smoked fish is produced. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that smoking fish can be divided into 3 main stages beginning with catching and transportation, followed by storage and processing, and finally further storage and transportation to fish shops for retail.

The process commences when fish are caught in nets and then transported by boat to a port. From this point, they are frozen and then later undergo a thawing process in fresh water. The next stage is to slice open the fish and put them in a salt water solution that also contains some amount of yellow coloring. Following this, the actual smoking takes place.

After smoking, the fish are packaged in boxes and frozen at zero degrees centigrade in larger containers. They are finally grouped into cold storage bins and distributed by truck to shops to sell to consumers.
