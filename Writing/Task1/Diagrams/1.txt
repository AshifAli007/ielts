The diagram details the process involed for the production of pu-erh Raw tea and Ripe tea.

Overall, it is readily apparent that there are 3 main stages of the process beginning with inactivation of certain enzymes and dryying in sun followed by either fermentation or aging and finally storage in case of Raw Tea and Compression in case of Ripe tea.

The process for both varieties commences with the frying in pan to deactivate some kind of enzymes follwed by drying under sun after rolling out. The process after drying is different for each variety of tea.

For Ripe tea, the process goes through fermentation of loose Raw tea to get loose ripe tea which goes through compression to get the final form. In case of Raw tea, the leaves are first compressed. After this step or subsequent to this step, the tea is aged, rather than fermemented and the pu-reh raw teas is then available for use.

===========================================

The diagram featured above details the steps by which pu’erh raw and ripened tea are produced. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that there are 3 main stages beginning with initial deactivation and drying, followed by either aging or fermentation and finally storage in the case of the raw tea and compression for the ripe tea.

The process for both varieties of tea commences when the leaves are fried in pans in order to deactivate specific enzymes. This is followed by rolling of the fried leaves and drying in the sun. In the next stage, the two kinds of tea are treated in different ways.

For the ripe tea, the loose raw tea is fermented with mold and then compressed to form the final product. In terms of the raw tea, the leaves are first compressed. Subsequent to this step, the tea is aged, rather than fermented, and the pu’erh raw tea is then available for use.
