The process diagram shows the steps for producing leather products.

Overall, it is readily apparent that there are 3 main stages in the process. The first stage includes Drying and transportation of animal skin to the factory where it processed for further use. Second stage includes washing and soaking and finally polishing of skin and transportation to factories to produce products with polished skin.

The process commences with removal of water from the animal skin followed by it's transportation to factory for further processing. From this point the skin is washed in lime water. Skin undergoes a flattening process after being socked in lime and after flattening is complete, skin is socked in Tannin and vegetable matter mixed in water.

After flattening and soaking, the next stage is to polish the skin so that products can be manufactured with it. Finally for manufacturing the products skin is transported to another factory via different transportation method where the skin is used to create producst such as purse, shoes, sandals etc.
