The map details the changes that occured to a park from 1980 till now.

Overall, it is clear that the park is more modernized by the addition of a playground, sitting arrangments and a barbequee. the pond remained unchanged throughout the years till now. 

In 1980, the park had two opening one at the west side and another at the south side of the park. A small pond can be seen near the west side gate surronted by 3 benches for sitting. To the south of pond a garden of flowers is located to the south of the pond which is attacehed to the south side gate of the park. On the north-west side a large area is covered by Trees only, opposite to that another garden much bigger than the one near pond can be seen.

Currently, the park has 4 openings at all sides of the garden which was the result of renovation of walking path in the park. The renovation also make more ways for people to sit around and a playground at place of bigger garden of flowers in the south east corner. The garden near pond is changed to have Bushes instead of flowers and the Tree area on the north east side went through multiple changes including the cut down of some trees to make place for chairs, desks and a barbecue.



===========================================

The map details alterations to a park in 1980 and the present day. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the park has become more developed for visitors with additional recreational space for outdoor eating, seating, and playing. The only subtraction relates to the flowers.

In 1980, there was an entrance on the left side above a pond surrounded by 3 benches and a second gate at the bottom of the park. Now, both gates have disappeared, the road is less straight and the pond has more benches around it. There are also two additional roads coming from the top and right of the diagram, sectioning off an area with trees, chairs, desks, and barbecue options (previously only containing trees).

In the bottom right corner of the map, a flowerbed has been replaced by a playground. A second space for flowers in the bottom left below the pond has also been removed in favor of wild bush.
