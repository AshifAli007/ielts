========================
The map describes changes to a city since 1950. Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the city has expanded to become considerably more residential and accessible, with the notable additions of a long lake and nearby business district.

In 1950, the townâ€™s population was 20,000 and it has increased tenfold to 200,000. Previously, there was a limited area for homes, all to the north of the major road running east to west. At present, the residential area has greatly grown in all directions and there are now additional major roads in the southern half of the city.

Moreover, the narrow river running through the town has been dammed to create a large lake that stretches from the western to eastern edge of the residential area. The business district which was confined to the center of the map is now larger and includes the northern and southern shores of the lake. The bridge over the river is now over the lake and there is another bridge near the dam in the east. Finally, there is presently a second government building to the south and the airport located to the east has more than doubled in size.
