The given map illustrates the plan for a house and it's development plan for different alterations in the home.

Overall, it is readily apparent that a large garden area and a lot of empty space would be removed from the current house to make space for parking, rooms and bigger hall. Kitchen area would also be renovated in the new plan. The garden on the north side of house would remain unchanged.

Curretnly, The House is surroned by 2 gardens from north and south covering the whole edge. a large hall can be seen at the south west end with a bathroom attached to it on norht side. Just opposite that a Living room is present attached to a study/bedrrom on the left. On the west edge of house you can see an entrace with study/bedroom just above that.
